title:  "Expanding the Tokio project"
---

If you've been following Rust in the last month, you've probably seen the
announcements of the [Futures] library and the [Tokio] framework that sits on
top of it. There's been some confusion about how these projects fit together,
and what the overall story is shaping up to be.

[Futures]: http://aturon.github.io/blog/2016/08/11/futures/

**Today, we're happy to announce the formation of the Tokio Core Team, as well
as an overall plan for the two projects and how they fit together**. The team
consists of Carl Lerche, Alex Crichton, and myself; more on that below.

## An early vision of the I/O stack

There are three primary levels of abstraction in Tokio:

- At the highest level is a *service*, which is where you write a server
  application. Following the [Finagle] model, a service is a simple thing: it's
  a function from requests to *futures* of responses. This simple model is
  incredibly powerful: it separates the implementation of request processing
  from the implementation of the underlying protocol, and makes it possible to
  factor out an ecosystem of *middleware*. All of this seamlessly support async
  I/O via futures. Middleware runs the gamut from connection pooling to
  retry/timeout logic to logging to load balancing -- all of which can be
  written independently from any particular service or protocol. Read
  [Your Server as a Function] for the inspiration.

  The [tokio-service] crate provides core trait definitions for
  services. Servers that can process particular request/response types (like
  HTTP) are offered as standalone crates. **Building an http server is just a
  matter of writing a function from http requests to futures of http
  responses.**

- In the middle are *protocols*, like HTTP or Mux. Here, too, there is a lot of
  complexity worth factoring out, both at the transport layer and in the
  protocol "dispatch" layer. **The [tokio-proto] crate provides re-usable
  components for building new protocol implementations**. We expect for there to
  be a similar kind of "middleware" ecosystem at these lower levels.

- At the lowest level is the *event loop*, which is where we bridge the OS's I/O
  facilities into the world of futures. **The [tokio-core] crate provides a
  generic event loop for doing async I/O with futures**. If you want complete
  control, that's the entry point for you; it's particularly useful for cases
  that don't fit so nicely into the service model, such as proxy servers.

**In short, we want the Tokio project to be a "one stop shop" for doing
futures-based I/O**, whether at the highest level of prebuilt protocols, or
the lowest level of the core event loop.

In our view, the lowest layers should strive to be zero cost and fully general,
allowing them to be used in a large number of contexts. As you go up the stack,
getting closer to an actual application, things tend to get more specific and
opinionated, and may impose some cost. [Futures] themselves are a zero-cost and
very general abstraction in Rust, and the [tokio-core] crate imposes very little
cost. Particular protocol implementations and middleware, on the other hand, can
be more opinionated.

We'll have a lot more to say about all of these layers (and the ones beneath
them, like futures) in the coming weeks on our various blogs. Stay tuned!

## A note on project management

We're following a Rust-like model, starting with a core team that reaches major
decisions through a consensus process. At the moment, this process is fairly
informal: it plays out on the issue tracker, PRs, and gitter channels. But as
the library begins to mature, we plan to move toward an RFC-like process for
major changes. We are eager for the Tokio project to truly be a Rust community
project. It's going to have a lot of stakeholders, and we want to make sure
those stakeholders have a voice just as we do in the Rust project itself.

As for the core futures library, it remains separate from the Tokio project, in
part because we imagine it heading toward ownership by the rust-lang org in the
relatively near future. (That's a possible eventual path for Tokio as well, but
the road will be much longer.)

## Jumping in

Tokio is an ambitious project, and it's going to take a strong community to
really get it off the ground.  Many from the Rust community have already jumped
in to contribute, even in these extremely early days; that's helped us get some
of our early-stage integrations going, including [curl], [tls] and
[redis]. We're also working with Sean McArthur to get a Tokio-integrated [Hyper]
off the ground. If you're interested in any of this, any other integrations, or
the core libraries, we'd love to [hear from you]!

[hear from you]: https://gitter.im/tokio-rs/tokio

If you're coming to RustConf, we'll see you there, either at the
[Tokio hack night] or at the talk about futures at RustConf itself. Come say
hello, and join in the fun!
