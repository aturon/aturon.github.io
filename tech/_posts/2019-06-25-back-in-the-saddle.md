title:  "Back in the saddle"

Hi y'all! After some time away on mental health leave (which you can read more
about [here] if you're curious), I'm fully back to work at the Mozilla Rust
team. I won't be returning to Lang Team or Async work, but will instead be
working full-time on compiler engineering. The first goal is to work with Zoxc
and others to help ship parallel rustc. After that, there's tons to do on the
trait system. I'm very excited about focusing on some actual Rust programming.

I wanted to take this opportunity to thank Mozilla, which has been very
accommodating and understanding with my need to take some time, and especially
to thank my dear friend Niko, who quietly and competently took on the workload
around this transition.
