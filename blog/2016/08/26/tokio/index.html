  <p>If you&rsquo;ve been following Rust in the last month, you&rsquo;ve probably seen the
announcements of the <a href="http://aturon.github.io/blog/2016/08/11/futures/">Futures</a> library and the <a href="https://medium.com/@carllerche/announcing-tokio-df6bb4ddb34">Tokio</a> framework that sits on
top of it. There&rsquo;s been some confusion about how these projects fit together,
and what the overall story is shaping up to be.</p>

<p><strong>Today, we&rsquo;re happy to announce the formation of the Tokio Core Team, as well
as an overall plan for the two projects and how they fit together</strong>. The team
consists of Carl Lerche, Alex Crichton, and myself; more on that below.</p>

<h2 id="an-early-vision-of-the-i-o-stack">An early vision of the I/O stack</h2>

<p>There are three primary levels of abstraction in Tokio:</p>

<ul>
<li>At the highest level is a <em>service</em>, which is where you write a server
application. Following the <a href="http://finagle.github.io/">Finagle</a> model, a service is a simple thing: it&rsquo;s
a function from requests to <em>futures</em> of responses. This simple model is
incredibly powerful: it separates the implementation of request processing
from the implementation of the underlying protocol, and makes it possible to
factor out an ecosystem of <em>middleware</em>. All of this seamlessly support async
I/O via futures. Middleware runs the gamut from connection pooling to
retry/timeout logic to logging to load balancing &ndash; all of which can be
written independently from any particular service or protocol. Read
<a href="https://monkey.org/%7Emarius/funsrv.pdf">Your Server as a Function</a> for the inspiration.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-service">tokio-service</a> crate provides core trait definitions for
  services. Servers that can process particular request/response types (like
  HTTP) are offered as standalone crates. <strong>Building an http server is just a
  matter of writing a function from http requests to futures of http
  responses.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>In the middle are <em>protocols</em>, like HTTP or Mux. Here, too, there is a lot of
complexity worth factoring out, both at the transport layer and in the
protocol &ldquo;dispatch&rdquo; layer. <strong>The <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-proto">tokio-proto</a> crate provides re-usable
components for building new protocol implementations</strong>. We expect for there to
be a similar kind of &ldquo;middleware&rdquo; ecosystem at these lower levels.</p></li>
<li><p>At the lowest level is the <em>event loop</em>, which is where we bridge the OS&rsquo;s I/O
facilities into the world of futures. <strong>The <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-core">tokio-core</a> crate provides a
generic event loop for doing async I/O with futures</strong>. If you want complete
control, that&rsquo;s the entry point for you; it&rsquo;s particularly useful for cases
that don&rsquo;t fit so nicely into the service model, such as proxy servers.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In short, we want the Tokio project to be a &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; for doing
futures-based I/O</strong>, whether at the highest level of prebuilt protocols, or
the lowest level of the core event loop.</p>

<p>In our view, the lowest layers should strive to be zero cost and fully general,
allowing them to be used in a large number of contexts. As you go up the stack,
getting closer to an actual application, things tend to get more specific and
opinionated, and may impose some cost. <a href="http://aturon.github.io/blog/2016/08/11/futures/">Futures</a> themselves are a zero-cost and
very general abstraction in Rust, and the <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-core">tokio-core</a> crate imposes very little
cost. Particular protocol implementations and middleware, on the other hand, can
be more opinionated.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll have a lot more to say about all of these layers (and the ones beneath
them, like futures) in the coming weeks on our various blogs. Stay tuned!</p>

<h2 id="a-note-on-project-management">A note on project management</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re following a Rust-like model, starting with a core team that reaches major
decisions through a consensus process. At the moment, this process is fairly
informal: it plays out on the issue tracker, PRs, and gitter channels. But as
the library begins to mature, we plan to move toward an RFC-like process for
major changes. We are eager for the Tokio project to truly be a Rust community
project. It&rsquo;s going to have a lot of stakeholders, and we want to make sure
those stakeholders have a voice just as we do in the Rust project itself.</p>

<p>As for the core futures library, it remains separate from the Tokio project, in
part because we imagine it heading toward ownership by the rust-lang org in the
relatively near future. (That&rsquo;s a possible eventual path for Tokio as well, but
the road will be much longer.)</p>

<h2 id="jumping-in">Jumping in</h2>

<p>Tokio is an ambitious project, and it&rsquo;s going to take a strong community to
really get it off the ground.  Many from the Rust community have already jumped
in to contribute, even in these extremely early days; that&rsquo;s helped us get some
of our early-stage integrations going, including <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-curl">curl</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-tls">tls</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-redis">redis</a>. We&rsquo;re also working with Sean McArthur to get a Tokio-integrated <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/">Hyper</a>
off the ground. If you&rsquo;re interested in any of this, any other integrations, or
the core libraries, we&rsquo;d love to <a href="https://gitter.im/tokio-rs/tokio">hear from you</a>!</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re coming to RustConf, we&rsquo;ll see you there, either at the
<a href="https://tokiohacknight.splashthat.com/">Tokio hack night</a> or at the talk about futures at RustConf itself. Come say
hello, and join in the fun!</p>
